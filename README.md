This is a project to update my previous website. This version will be created using React, Nextjs and Typescript. I hope it can be useful as a learning experience to extend my nextjs and typescript knowledge. I intend to implement new features, such as smooth scroll, a soundcloud player, a youtube player and better photo carousels.
